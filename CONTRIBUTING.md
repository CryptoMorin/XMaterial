I'm really thankful for all the bug fixes and performance improvements.\
Even if you changed a single line that has a good impact on the performance, it's welcomed. 

Some changes may need a discussion about quality and usage.
Make sure to explain your changes clearly when creating a pull request.
Most of the pull requests are merged directly into the master branch.

You have to import the original Bukkit JAR directly to the plugin as SkullUtils uses `com.mojang.authlib`
This project has no original maven repository and cannot have one legally.
It's also used for JavaX nullability annotations.

### Rules
* Make sure you know what you're doing and tested the utility on different versions.
* Do not use Java streams unless it's for a constant. Use for-each loops instead.
* Use method and variable names that make sense and are related to the context.
* Don't use Optional everywhere that can return null.
* Using Guava's lib and Apache Commons is a plus, but make sure that what you're using is supported in
older versions of Bukkit.
* Add JavaDocs with proper formatting. It's also preferred to explain how the complex parts of the method work
inside the method. Use simple English when possible.
* All the functions used in the utilities should be compatible with Bukkit, Spigot and Paper.
* Change the class version properly. If you're not sure how versioning works don't change it.
* Each utility should be independent except the ones that are intended to be dependent.
Functions such as ISFLAT boolean check should not depend on XMaterial's isNewVersion() Except XBlock which is intended
since XBlock already uses XMaterial for materials. Same for XParticle and ParticleDisplay.
